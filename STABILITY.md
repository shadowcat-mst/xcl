## Stability

This is experimental. We make no guarantee of stability.

## Versioning

This distribution uses the standard Perl two component number versioning scheme
but increments it based on [semver](https://semver.org) semantics. For example,
a version number of `1.23` is treated as the semver-based version number
`1.2.3`.

## Releasing

This distribution and its source code is maintained and released on GitHub,
with the CPAN serving as the canonical repository. This means that hotfixes,
changes in documentation, and experimental features will be released on GitHub,
only shipping stable releases to the CPAN.
